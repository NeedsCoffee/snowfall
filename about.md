        <p>Robin Bayliss arrived in Snowball Falls by accident, a wrong turn, a blizzard, and a highly unreliable satnav. Originally from a small British village known more for drizzle than drama, she quickly fell in love with the town’s twinkle lights, scandalous gingerbread, and highly suspicious snowglobes.</p>
        <p>These days, she can often be found tucked into the back corner of Snowdrop Books, sipping cocoa of uncertain origin and “gathering inspiration” (which definitely doesn’t mean eavesdropping, probably). She insists all the stories are entirely fictional. The townsfolk aren’t convinced.</p>
